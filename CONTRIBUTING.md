## Pull Requests

- PSR-12 Coding Standard - Check the code style with $ composer cs and fix it with $ composer cbf.

- Add tests! - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
